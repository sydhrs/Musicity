Musicity - Mood Based Music Recommendation System

Tools: CNN for Model Training, JAVA, XML for Development

Platform: Google Collabs, Android Studio

Music has always been a fascination of the masses. People listen to songs that appeal to their nature and mood. Music recommendation applications already exist. However, very few applications employ a recommendation system based on emotions of the user. The feed of songs recommended are by and large according to the listening preferences of the user. As humans we have learned to take clues from visual cues and deduce and decide the human emotion. On the other hand, training a model or computer system to do the same using an algorithm is a somewhat difficult task. The project takes inspiration from filter systems deployed by Snapchat and the music recommendation aspects of apps such as Spotify and Soundcloud. We wish to add to this. Our application model will recommend users a song based on their current emotion. We have used CNN as our training algorithm. We have used a considerable number of images for the first phase to train the model to classify the detected emotion into happy and unhappy. The model first detects a face from a still image and crops out the face. It then removes the background and applies a convolution mask to detect angles of various elements of the face. We are hopeful that our application will be launched in the commercial circuit and music fanatics everywhere will be able to make use of it.
